    <h2 class="class-attribute">HTML PROJECT</h2>
    <p>This is the first html project, its about how to understand the tag used in HTML. In HTML tags are being devided into two types</p>
  
    <ol>
        <li>semantic tags</li> <br> 
        <li>Non-semantic</li> Tags
    </ol>
    <P><h2>Semantic Tags</h2>
        The tags which accurately describe their purpose and describe the type of their content are called semantic tags. For example,
       (h1) Header (h1)
        From the above code, we can accurately tell that the content inside the (h1) tag is a heading.
        Some examples of semantic tags are 一 (h1)-(h6)<P>
    <p><h2>Non-Semantic Tags</h2>
        HTML non-semantic tags do not have a specific meaning or purpose. They are used to create general-purpose containers for content without providing any additional meaning or context. <br>
        For example,<br>
        (span)Some Text(/span) <br>
        From the above code, we cannot extract the meaning of the text. This code could come from any section of the document thus it adds no semantic value to the document.<br>
        Some examples of non-semantic tags are 一 (div)</p>
